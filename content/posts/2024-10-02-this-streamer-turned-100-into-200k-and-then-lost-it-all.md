Imagine depositing $100 onto your favourite casino, then running that money up to $200k before withdrawing, playing solely on Dice. A feat only the most degenerate of gamblers could accomplish. Well that’s exactly what Kick streamer BossmanJack did, and in true degen fashion, he lost every single penny less than 36 hours later.

BossmanJack is far from some ordinary gambling streamer, his ability to show the absolute pits of gambling addiction is simply unique, happily smashing up his furniture and equipment when the going gets tough. This goes both ways, as no one in their right mind would only withdraw once he hit over $180k from a $100 stake. As soon as BossmanJack was able to take the money out, he called his family and started making promises about what he could give them as presents, saying he would buy his mom a car, and his dad a steak dinner. However, as this tale often goes with gambling, BossmanJack lost all of those winnings less than two days later.



I’ll post the video below. It was a bunch of streams over the course of a few days before he managed to lose it all, but it started off strongly with a -$30k on Dice within a few minutes of switching on the stream to give you a little teaser for the video:

So uhh… yeah, that was pretty depressing. One little side note I would like to point out is that the $180k withdrawn at the beginning of the video seemed to come out smoothly, a small W for Shuffle amongst the very best degeneracy online gambling has to offer. I will say though, I believe BossmanJack was sponsored by Shuffle, but this was his own money deposited. There is a lot of speculation going round these days about whether BossmanJack does fake balance streams, but one thing is for sure: This rollercoaster of emotions was very much real, he is a true gambling degen and very much shows the highs and lows of gambling in a realistic fashion.



For the few hours that he actually had the winnings, he was nothing but boastful about owning the money, saying he is “richer than you’ll ever be” when responding to criticism from his chat. The irony of going from that, to $0 in the space of a few days, and still owing $1000s to people in loans, couldn’t be sweeter. Don’t gamble kids.
